== WMF Camera Plugin ==
Enables the Windows Media Foundation backend to receive video frames from cameras.
As of now, supported formats are still hardcoded and limited to MJPG and NV12, but modifying for your needs should be fairly simple.

This compiles directly to a Qt multimedia plugin that can replace the previous wmf plugin to enable the additional functionailty.

There is no guarantee of function, as I use this only for my own purposes with a very specific set of cameras.

Thanks to the ESCAPI project for providing the capturing class.
